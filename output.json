With the help of A.I,\nmachines will be able to learn, solve problems, plan things, think, etc. Artificial\nIntelligence, for example, is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. In\nthe field of technology, Artificial Intelligence is evolving rapidly day by day and it\nis believed that in the near future, artificial intelligence is going to change human\nlife very drastically and will most probably end all the crises of the world by\nsorting out the major problems. Our life in this modern age depends largely on\ncomputers. It is almost impossible to think about life without computers. We need\ncomputers in everything that we use in our daily lives. So it becomes very\nimportant to make computers intelligent so that our lives become easy. Artificial\nIntelligence is the theory and development of computers, which imitates the\nhuman intelligence and senses, such as visual perception, speech recognition,\ndecision-making, and translation between languages. Artificial Intelligence has\nbrought a revolution in the world of technology."
